        <h2>Why manatees rock and deserve love? according to me</h2>
        <p>In 6th grade, one of our assignments was to make a pamphlet about endangered animals and how we can save them. I chose the manatee, why? I think they're beautiful, and not only that but they're harmless. They're very friendly and curious but for some reason they're endangered. I think this mammal deserves much more love and protection, since they're not evil or cruel like dolphins. Just think about the manatee (Benjamin) from the little mermaid 3. Througout the movie he wants to help the antagonist choose the path of good, and even when the antagonist ends up in jail, he is by her side as her personal therapist hoping for the antagonist to reflect on her wrongdoings. Manatees are such nice animals that even in the media they're shown with a heart of gold. So love them and try to sympathize with their situation.</p>

        <h3>Manatee apreciation over the world</h3>
            Additionally it seems like i'm not the only person who loves manatees considering that there's an organization called "Save the Manatees" whose goal is to protect manatees and their aquatic habitat for future generations. Fun fact the manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids. In West African folklore, they were considered sacred and thought to have been once human. Killing one was taboo and required penance. They're so loved that they were seem as a human. They're the best even the animal crossing game has a character named Wardle who manages and sells furniture to the player.
