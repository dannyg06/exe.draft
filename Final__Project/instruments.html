                    <h2>Perfect Duo (Piano and Guitar)</h2>
                    <p>Since little I had a a fascination with musical instruments, but one that stood out to me the most was the piano, so I made it my goal to one day learn how to play it, ironically enough my first instrument was the guitar. I don't know what made me buy it but to this day i'm still happy with my purchase. As much as I love the guitar I still like the piano better, but i'm amazed at the varieties of guitars that exist. Additionally there's a bunch of songs that make the guitar a perfect instrument. Songs like "TV" by Billie Eilish, or "Teardrops in my Guitar" by Taylor Swift are few to mention, but manages to evoke a sad yet comforting feeling with an acoustic guitar. I respect the guitar but I have a profound love for the piano, as I have mention before, I'm currently taking piano lessons, and one of my favorite things to do with the piano are the waltz. Songs written in the 3/4 time signature are very interesting to me as they sound playful and fast paced. Some songs I love to play in the piano are "Love makes the world go round" and "The Entertainer".</p>

                    <p>Now, if you seek to learn these instruments but you can only afford to learn one, You can watch the following video that may help you make a decision.</p>

                    <p>After making your decision, you may feel this rush of energy going through your body, with a whole new world of endless possible things you could play, yet your mind goes blank at the same time, and you're stuck without knowing what to play. Well personally I would recommend choosing one album in particular and learning the songs that already have a piano instrumentation or you could play songs from games OST.</p>

                        *P.S. If you're interested in knowing my opinion of  the relation between games and music then you should definitely check out my next page that talks more about it.</p>
