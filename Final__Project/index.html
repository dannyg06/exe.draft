                    <h2>Music and it's Impact</h2>
                    <p>Ever since i was little I can recall the impact music has had on me. I mean all it took is for one song to appear on the radio and I would already be dancing to it like a maniac. Now that i've grown up, I think it's amazing how I can listen to a song that somehow manages to evokes feelings and memories, take me to new worlds. Music can boost or calm my mood. The most amazing thhing about muaic is that it doesn't limit itself to some music notes, no! Mathematically there are 82,500,000,000,000,000,000 (eighty two and one half SEXTILLION) possible 10 note melodies. The existence of such a vast ocean of melodies fill me with hope, helping me look forward each day waiting for something new. </p>

                    <h3>Music & Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>My love for music has lead me to take piano classes. There's something so special about how soft or playful a piano can sound, it's truly amazing; and something that I really enjoy playing are ballads and waltz. They sound so comforting to me, which just sparks my love for music even more. Some piano songs I personally like are "Love is not enough" by Ashe, "Ylang Ylang" By FKJ, "Gymnopedie No. 1"  y Erik Satie, and "Duet" from OMORI.  </p>
